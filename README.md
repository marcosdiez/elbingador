El Bingador
===========


`El Bingador` is an app to help you play bingo with multiple scorecards.

The idea is quite simple:

You type all your bingo scorecards before the starts. 

Whenever the game starts, you just tell `El Bingador` the numbers that are randomly drawn.

`El Bingador` will make virtually mark in all the scorecards at once and will eventually tell you which card won and how.

Things to think about
---------------------

There are rumors that some bingos run on donations and therefore the combined price of the prizes is bigger than buying a significant amount of scorecards
